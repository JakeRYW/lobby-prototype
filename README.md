# Lobby Prototype

This is an **early** prototype for a party game lobby system.

## Roadmap

-   Users can create a lobby with a unique code
-   Users can join an existing lobby with a provided code
-   Users can draw themselves upon joining a lobby
-   Host can start the game when all users are connected
-   Come up with a billion dollar idea for what happens once the host starts
-   $$$
